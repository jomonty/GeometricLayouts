# GeometricLayouts

## Summary
This project was created as part of a technical challenge, the counterpart frontend is available [here](https://github.com/jomonty/GeometricLayouts-Frontend). I decided to attempt to make the calculator agnostic of grid size, which had a few challenges but I enjoyed working through them and getting familiar with C#. 

## Built with
* .NET Core
  * C#
  * xunit for testing

## Brief
- Calculate the triangle coordinates for an image with right triangles such that for a given row (A-F) and column (1-12) you can produce any of the triangles in the layout below.

Each non-hypotenuse side of the triangle is as follows:
